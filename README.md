# Bizzick's Bar & Grill 

This site was built using a template as a base, and was the first multi-page website I built.

## How It's Made:

The site is built from Solid State by HTML5 up/pixelarity and was inspired by a work offer I saw on freelancer for a multi-page bar website. Despite not winning the contract, I decided to put the request into action!

## Optimizations
<br/>
I heavily edited the original CSS to incorporate a different colour scheme, logs and to host background images.

This site initially integrated Google Maps API - but it's currently dormant and held by a placeholder.

I also had to use Google Drive API for hosting PDF menus.

I wrote all copy myself and tried to make it as authentic as possible, The flow of the website is designed to push you to 
review their menus, find the location of the bar or contact them. - This matches the intended use case for the site that the
client would have had.

## Lessons Learned:
<br/>
I enjoyed rewiring the template and it was good practice to review and adjust complex code successfully 

The google maps API was difficult to set up, but I learned a lot about how it works. 
Ultimately I took it down because it requires a billing agreement in place to maintain.

API Keys require a certain amount of security and should be kept backend only, 
this was the first project I used one in and it was a good reminder of that.

The site could be further enhanced with an owner login and the abilty to upload and change the pdf menus.

One major flaw with the site - I made it look **TOO** good and can't visit the bar because it's fictional!!
